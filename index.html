                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p> My main goal is get a job as junior JavaScript developer. Since about 2000 I have been programming, 
                    in various languages ​​such as VB, C ++, C #, these were mostly projects for myself, but some were made to order,
                    in general I go through life with programming, for me this is an interesting area. 
                    Of course, during this time I could become a professional, but life does not always allow me 
                    to do what I love do, I had to deal with not loved ones, but three years ago 
                    I decided that I needed to change something and went to study at courses. 
                    I went to different courses before and studied not only programming, basically everything 
                    related to theory was good, but as soon as the practice began it was clear that 
                    it was just not enough. I hope, I will go this way  with dignity.</p>

            <section class="main_section-skills">
                <h3>Skills:</h3>
                <p> I just started a serious study of web development in September of this year, 
                    before that I also studied about 2 years at a computer school, but there more time was kill to show 
                    what development technologies exist, and less time to practice of them. 
                    After completing those courses, I started to study Python myself at first it was difficult, 
                    but in half a year I mastered it at an average level, making my project, 
                    unfortunately I could not finish it, but I think I’ll get back to the idea of ​​the project,
                    perhaps already in vanile JavaScript.
                    One way or another, I don’t regret the time spent, as I like to study and I study all the time,
                    I would like only to be more efficient.</p>

                <p>Once I did a project on CodeIgnater for a library of computer school books. 
                   I did not post it on the githab. Вelow, followed by the projects I have already done at The Rolling Scopes School.</p>

                <p> Some of this projects still require refactoring, but they are completely working.
                    I spent many hours working on them, they were interesting.
                    My first hackathon took place in EPAM then I didn’t know about NodeJS almost nothing, 
                    I had to quickly dig in, but we barely had time to do only the workpiece, 
                    since I was doing code alone and didn’t sleep for three days! It was great!

                <h3>English level:</h3>
                <p> After graduation from evening school where I had been learning English two years, 
                    I studied English on my own. After 13 years I studied at MSLU in absentia (2 courses), 
                    but there was not enough time for practice. Basically I studied English while reading the documentation, 
                    my colloquial English is very weak. I plan to go to English courses soon. 
                    I have to make sure that I have programming skills, but anyway I like English.
